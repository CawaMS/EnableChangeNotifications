# Enable Change Notifications Private Preview - Application Change Analysis

Thank you for your interest in the Change Notifications private preview from [Azure Monitor's Application Change Analysis feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/change-analysis). The preview has concluded, and we will be ending support for this implementation of notifications in 2024. We recommend using Azure Monitor's native support for querying the Resource Graph for resource change data alerts. 

For more information, see the [announcement blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-observability-blog/query-azure-resource-graph-from-azure-monitor/ba-p/3918298) and [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/azure-monitor-data-explorer-proxy).
